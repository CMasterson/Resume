\section{Hobbies \& Interests}
\subsection{Coding}
I like to tinker with ideas and languages.\\
I build tools in Python to help friends and family. I have experimented in Golang to build a replica of the WWII Enigma encryption machine. For Nuit Blanche I helped bring a statue to life with Arduino. I have been teaching myself Unity using C\# with the intention of creating simple games.\\
Most recently I learned \LaTeX to create this resume.
\subsection{Makerspace}
I volunteer as the Chair of the Board of Directors for a Toronto makerspace and spend my time ensuring that our membership has a safe space to create and learn. We cater to a wide array of disciplines and offer classes to the general public.
\subsection{Climbing}
I was introduced to bouldering by a co-op and now head to the climbing gym at least once a week. I thoroughly enjoy the combination of physicality and problem solving required.
\subsection{Outdoors}
When the weather permits my partner and I go to Seaton Park to the outdoor archery range. We also travel to the Escarpment for hikes and Algonquin Park for portaging trips with friends.
\subsection{Gaming}
In my down time I enjoy catching up on some new releases and revisiting older, classic video games.\\
At least weekly I meet with friends to play tabletop games.
I regularly play in and occasionally run D\&D 5e campaigns.
